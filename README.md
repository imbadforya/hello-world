# hello-world
first repository ever
Well, time to change some things, both in this litle file and in my life!
I always dreamed to become a proper indie game dev and artist some day, and I'm now ready to make this dream happen.
It will be a long hard road ; right now I'm nothing but a kind of hobbyist factotum... So there's no time to waste!
